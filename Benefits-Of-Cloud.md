## Scalability

The cloud allows us to scale our allocated resources depending upon the required resources.
The cloud can scale upto infinite resources unless the application itself has bottlenecks, like database and router issues.

## Elasticity

This is the ability of a cloud provider that defines how the server can increase and decrease its resources depending upon user load.

## Availability

Microsoft Azure provides 99.99% availability, which is known as four nine's in the industry.
This basically means the server will be down for only 0.01% time, which roughly means 4 minutes in a month.

## Agility

The speed with which we can setup a server and get it running on the cloud is much more faster on the server compared to on prem.

## Disaster Recovery

The ability of a system to recover from faiure within a period of time and how much data is lost.

## Global Reach

Microsoft has data centers all over the world and users can easily setup services with fast access speeds across the globe.

## Security

Nicrosoft provides top notch physical security for its data centers, they are located in isolated and very hard to access areas.

## Range of services

Azure provedes a plethora of services which one can use, the services cover almost all the required tools, infrastructure etc which may ben needed for an application.

## Cost Savings
One major benefit of cloud computing is cost effectiveness.

The major reason that microsoft can do this is due to the huge number of servers they procure at once.
They also pick the best areas with cheap electricity and internet rates.
In summary it will be almost impossible for any company to match Microsoft on cost efficiency.

Another way cloud provides cost benefits is using autoscaling, i.e you only pay for how much you use.

### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

CapEx is money invested in assets that return investment over time.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

OpEx is money spent every day on project expenses.

> Consumption Based Model: Pay per minute, pay per hour, pay per execution etc.
