# Serverless

There are still servers, it's just that you don't interact with it.
With PaaS things like scaling and App tiers are user responsibilites, on serverless it's cloud providers.
Serverless means not worrying about the server at all, you only pay for what you use on serverless which means the bill may come as $0 too.
