# Azure Policy

- Governance
  A body or group of people who set the policies for a larger group of people.

Allows us to create policies for compliance across all Azure resources.

Examples of Built-In Policies:

- Require certain version of a software
- Restrict resources to a specific location
- Apply tags with default values
- Restrict resource types

Can create custom policies using JSON for more specific needs.

## Azure Blueprint

Allows us to create templates for subscriptions with ARM templates, resource groups, roles and policies all bundled together.
This can be used to quickly add new subscriptions. Azure also has hundreds of pre defined blueprints for various needs.

## Azure Cloud Adoption Framework

A collection of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices and tools from Microsoft to accelerate Azure adoptions.

Has guides for various stages:

- Strategy
- Planning
- Ready
- Adopt
- Govern
- Manage
